#Instructions

Build single page application which has the ability to dynamically create interactive charts from a user provided data set.

- Provide a way for the user to upload a CSV formatted data file.
- Display the data in a data table.
- Represent the data in at least two relevant chart types, using a charting library of your choice
such as D3.js.
- Add interactivity to the charts. For example, when clicking on a specific chart element, it should
highlight the relevant cell in the data table.
